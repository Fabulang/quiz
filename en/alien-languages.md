1. Alison must decode a signal from an alien world

   * as soon as possible
   * in time for a press conference
   * within a few weeks
   * before the President arrives

2. The General tells Alison

   * she can have anyone she needs on her team
   * she can use all of the computers on the base
   * she and her team will be paid a lot of money
   * to reveal the names of people who might try to stop them

3. When Alison's team finally finishes their work, Alison feels

   * awkward
   * thrilled
   * scared

   because the alien signal

   * is inconsequential
   * is impossible to translate
   * is a message of war
   * is a message of peace

4. The President and the press come to the base. They want to know

   * whether the aliens are aggressive or friendly
   * where the signal comes from
   * what the aliens are like

5. It turns out that the signal

   * wasn't intended to be received by the Earth
   * is simply a joke from the aliens
   * isn't actually from aliens at all
   * is a message asking humans to be tidier
