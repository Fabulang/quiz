1. Harriet is in prison because

   * her behaviour undermined the government
   * she was accused of treason
   * she played music that was considered obscene
   * she attacked government buildings

2. Harriet is often allowed out of her cell

   * to play music for the guards' amusement
   * to serve beer to the guards
   * to get some fresh air
   * because she can't escape anyway

3. The country is governed by

   * foreign invaders
   * a strict religious group
   * the army

4. Harriet's friends are planning to escape, but she can't escape with them because she believes

   * she's too slow
   * she's not strong enough
   * they will get caught
   * the security is too strong

5. At the end, Harriet plays a song because

   * it will cause a distraction
   * she's too afraid to escape, after all
   * the Prison Chief told her to
   * she wants to make the guards angry

   and she smiles because

   * she knows her friends will escape
   * she's accepted that she will never escape
   * she's gone mad
