1. Elijah is looking after the hamster because

   * the teacher is having lunch
   * it's his own hamster
   * it's a punishment
   * he wants to

2. Elijah takes the hamster out of the cage because

   * the girl asks him to
   * he needs to feed it
   * he wants to hold it

3. The hamster escapes because

   * it bites the girl
   * the girl puts it on the floor
   * the cage falls down
   * it jumps from the girl's hands

4. Elijah asks if his mum loves him, because

   * he wants her to help him
   * he's feeling insecure
   * he's worried he's in trouble

5. Elijah's plan is to

   * put a new hamster in the cage
   * use a new hamster to find the old hamster
   * find the hamster quickly
   * tell the teacher what happened
