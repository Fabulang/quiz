1. The garden around Amanda's apartment block

   * is an eyesore
   * is dangerous
   * is so overgrown it's hard to pass through

2. Every morning, Amanda

   * does some gardening
   * argues with her neighbours
   * goes to work early
   * continues digging a hole

3. Eventually, fruit and flowers grow in the garden. As a result,

   * the apartment block also looks nicer
   * children start playing in the garden
   * people come out and get to know one another

4. When Amanda eats some fruit from the garden, her neighbours

   * tell her off for stealing
   * threaten to sue her
   * think she's an intruder
   * tell her to go away

5. Amanda is upset because

   * her neighbours didn't appreciate her work
   * she thought the fruit was for everyone
   * she feels embarrassed about the situation
   * she wanted to make friends with her neighbours

6. Amanda eventually leaves the apartment block. After she leaves,

   * no one continues to take care of the garden
   * all of the fruit in the garden is wasted
   * the neighbours dig up and get rid of the fruit and flowers
