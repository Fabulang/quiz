1. Decades ago, Adelaide was

   * an entertainer
   * the town's mayor
   * a ghost hunter
   * a builder

2. The theatre was special to Adelaide, because

   * she built it
   * the mayor dedicated it to her
   * she lived there
   * she performed in it for over sixty years

3. Before the theatre was abandoned, it was

   * an important part of the local culture
   * a meeting place for people who lived in the town
   * the most important building in the town
   * damaged by kids playing games

4. Adelaide appears as a ghost because

   * she's sad that people have forgotten the theatre
   * she's sad that people have forgotten her songs
   * she misses being the centre of attention
   * she's trying to scare the kids away

5. She disappears because Christian

   * enjoyed her performance
   * set a trap for her
   * cast a spell to make her leave
   * surprises her
