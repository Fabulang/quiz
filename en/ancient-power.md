1. The orb was hidden by

   * an ancient civilisation
   * Jacklyn's brother
   * Angelica's mother

   because it was too

   * dangerous
   * valuable
   * scary

2. Jacklyn and her brother don't talk to each other because

   * Jacklyn was obsessed with finding the orb
   * Jacklyn was always angry and rude
   * her brother thought she was insane
   * her brother wanted to find the orb too

3. When Jacklyn touches the orb, she realises

   * Angelica is her brother's daughter
   * Angelica is her husband's sister
   * Angelica is her auntie's granddaughter
   * she is Angelica's niece

4. Angelica burns the scroll because

   * she doesn't want anyone else to find the orb
   * she wants to destroy the orb
   * she wants to keep the orb for herself
   * she wants to bring about chaos

5. At the end, Jacklyn decides

   * to make up with her brother
   * to tell her brother that the orb doesn't exist
   * to stop looking for ancient artefacts
   * never to leave home again
