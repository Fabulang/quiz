1. At the beginning, the red balloon

   * is being held by a child
   * is thrown away by a child
   * is at the balloon shop
   * is stuck in a tree

2. The balloon

   * wanted to leave
   * didn't want to leave

   and once it began to rise

   * it couldn't stop
   * it enjoyed it
   * it didn't like it

3. The balloon looks down and sees

   * many different people's lives
   * a boy playing football on his own
   * a family buying a new house
   * that everyone in the city is laughing

4. The balloon comes back down, and

   * lands in a park
   * lands in a tree
   * someone catches it

5. At the end, the balloon feels

   * sad
   * exhilarated
   * enlightened
   * dizzy
