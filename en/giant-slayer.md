1. Håkon is a Viking ship-builder, but he wants to be

   * a warrior
   * a sailor
   * a fisherman
   * a ship's captain

   because he wants a life

   * with more adventure
   * with more danger
   * at sea, not on land

   So, one day, he sneaks aboard a ship.

2. The ship is attacked by a giant squid. Håkon is able to help because

   * he knows how the ship works
   * he's an excellent warrior
   * he's extremely strong
   * he's calm in the face of danger

   and he

   * helps the crew to evade the monster
   * becomes the captain immediately

3. They try to escape, but

   * the squid swims faster than their ship
   * they can't raise the sail
   * the crew don't listen to his instructions
   * the wind slows them down

4. Håkon kills the squid with a spear. How did he manage to do that?

   * He has excellent dexterity
   * It was just a lucky throw
   * He knew it was the last spear, so he threw it carefully
   * The captain's trust in him gave him the confidence he needed

5. The ending reveals that Håkon

   * became a respected warrior
   * went back to building ships
   * wants his grandson to become a warrior
   * was punished for sneaking aboard the ship
