   It has a design featuring an axolotl.

2. Christopher

   * has never seen an axolotl before
   * doesn't like axolotls
   * loves axolotls

3. He tells her that they're his favourite animal because

   * he doesn't want to upset her
   * it's true
   * they have funny faces

4. His daughter keeps buying him presents related to axolotls because

   * he always seems to like them
   * they are his favourite animal
   * he keeps asking for them
   * she isn't very thoughtful

5. Years later, Christopher explains why he loves axolotls:

   * they've brought him and his daughter together
   * his daughter likes them, so he does too
   * when they lose a limb, it grows back
   * there are so many different kinds of axolotl
