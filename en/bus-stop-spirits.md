1. A tourist asks about the *Bus-Stop of the Spirits*, because

   * he read an article about it online
   * he read about it in a leaflet
   * it's famous throughout the region

   but

   * there's no such thing
   * it's closed to visitors
   * you can't visit it with a pet
   * you can only reach it on foot

2. Elizabeth's manager has paid someone

   * to pretend the bus-stop is a tourist attraction
   * to write about the bus-stop's history
   * to write an article about traffic lights
   * to perform magic on the bus-stop

3. Elizabeth tells the tourist about the cabbage farmer's curse, but

   * she made the story up on the spot
   * she gets some of the details wrong
   * it's only a local legend, it isn't really true

4. Elizabeth told the story about the cabbage farmer because

   * the tourist threatened to call the manager
   * she wanted to amuse the tourist with a joke
   * she was bored, and wanted to amuse herself
   * it's her job to tell tourists about local history

5. The manager is delighted because more tourists

   * are visiting the area
   * are learning about local history
   * know the story of the cabbage farmer
   * are purchasing bus tickets and taxi fares
