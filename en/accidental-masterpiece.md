1. Geoffrey puts a painting on the wall, but he's made a mistake:

   * it wasn't the painting he was waiting to receive
   * it wasn't ready to be displayed
   * the delivery isn't due for another week

2. When art critics see the painting, they

   * lavish it with praise
   * criticise it severely
   * question whether it's genuine
   * describe it as offensive

3. When Geoffrey meets Jennifer, the Cleaner, he realises

   * the painting on the wall is literally rubbish
   * the painting on the wall is a fake
   * she is the artist known as Brush
   * she tricked him

4. The Curator issues a statement, and the critics

   * pretend that their earlier reviews were jokes
   * disagree vehemently with the statement
   * publish angry letters of complaint

5. Some time later, when Geoffrey reads the newspaper, he realises that

   * Jennifer the Cleaner
   * the Curator
   * he
  
   is the artist known as Brush.
