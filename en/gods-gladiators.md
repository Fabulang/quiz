1. In Ancient Rome, Lucia is a slave. Her master

   * treats her abusively
   * is an important man
   * wants to become a gladiator
   * is a professional gambler

2. The god Apollo gave Lucia a special power:

   * She can see what will happen next
   * She can influence what will happen next
   * She always has good luck
   * She always wins when gambling

   But she had to pay a price:

   * She can never lie
   * She'll always be a slave
   * She can only use the power to help her master
   * She can't keep any secrets

3. Lucia uses her power to help her master

   * cheat when he's gambling
   * steal money from his friend
   * become an important figure
   * throw lavish parties

   because

   * she wants to please him
   * he threatens to kill her if she doesn't
   * she has to use her power that way

4. The master's friend challenges the master to participate in

   * a fight to the death
   * a game of skill
   * a gambling game
   * friendly combat

5. The friend proposes a bet:
   
   If the friend wins, he'll receive

   * compensation from the master
   * the master's house and money
   * the master's slaves

   If the master wins, he'll receive

   * everything the friend owns
   * great honour and respect
   * a large sum of money
   * the friend's house

6. The friend offers this bet because

   * he believes the gods will help him
   * he thinks the master's arrogance will make him lose
   * he intends to cheat

   The master agrees because

   * he intends to use Lucia's power to help him
   * he knows he is better than his friend, so he will win
   * he is focused on what he could gain, so he doesn't think hard

7. In the end,

   * the master loses
   * the master wins
   
   and Lucia
   
   * goes to live with the friend
   * continues to live with the master
   * loses her special power
   * realises she never had any special power
