1. Philippa is on Mars

   * trying to find evidence of an alien civilisation
   * working on a project to build a city
   * trying to translate an alien language
   * because she lives there
   * to explore the caves below the surface

2. Other scientists

   * don't respect her work
   * think she's very amusing
   * tell her off for wasting government money
   * are grateful for the maps she makes

3. Tomorrow, Philippa

   * has to go back to Earth
   * plans to explore the south-eastern section of the caves
   * must complete her mission
   * must apply for more funding, so she can stay

4. Philippa finds a strange symbol. The symbol

   * looks a bit like an arrow
   * looks a bit like a hand
   * is intricate and complex -- signs of intelligent life
   * seems to be part of an alien language

5. Philippa follows the symbol into the caves, and finds

   * proof that aliens lived on Mars in the past
   * a secret door that leads to a cavern
   * a room with alien writing carved on the walls
   * nothing -- the symbol doesn't mean anything

   but

   * she is trapped and dies in the cave
   * no one will believe her
   * the evidence is destroyed
   * she is lost and might not be able to get out
