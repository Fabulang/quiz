1. Jennifer wants to see a particular statue because

   * she read about it in an old book
   * it was built in 1986, when she was born
   * she saw a photo of it in the library
   * there are only eight other statues like it

2. Hugh, a taxi driver, has never heard of the statue, because

   * its name has changed
   * it isn't there anymore
   * it's older than he is
   * he doesn't read books

3. Hugh makes a deal with Jennifer: if he can't find the statue,

   * he won't charge her
   * he'll buy her dinner
   * he'll give her a free tour of the city
   * he'll take her to see eight more statues

4. At the end of the day

   * Jennifer buys Hugh dinner
   * Hugh buys Jennifer dinner
   * Hugh wants to stop working
   * Jennifer can't pay Hugh

5. In fact,

   * Hugh *had* found the correct statue
   * the statue didn't really exist
   * the statue wasn't there anymore

   but Jennifer didn't tell Hugh because

   * she enjoyed spending time with him
   * she wanted to get a free tour of the city
   * she was embarrassed about making him work longer
   * she wanted to win the argument
