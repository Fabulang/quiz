1. The Mayor of the town resigns, because

   * he's escaping with the town's wealth
   * he's sad about doing a bad job
   * he doesn't know how to solve the town's problems
   * he thinks the townspeople don't want him anymore
   * he's an imposter

2. In the past, a rich family called the Fairfields
   
   * lived in the town
   * donated money to the town
   * built a school in the town
   * bought the town

3. The Fairfields left a gift to the town in their vault:

   * A lot of money
   * A valuable collection of portrait paintings
   * A reminder about what's truly precious in life

   But the town isn't allowed to open the vault until

   * one year from now
   * one hundred years from now
   * ninety-nine years from now
   * the last descendant of the Fairfields dies

4. The Mayor offers to open the vault because

   * he doesn't want them to realise it was opened before
   * it's something he can do to help the town
   * he's the Mayor, so he should open it
   * he hopes he can get in first and lock them out

5. Inside, they don't find anything of monetary value, because

   * the Mayor has already taken those things
   * love is more valuable than money
   * the Mayor already used the money to fund the beer festival
   * it's already been taken by thieves
