1. Even before she meets him, Tanya doesn't like Alan, because

   * he went to a prestigious school
   * his CV is too long
   * he's late for the interview
   * he's got no experience

2. She thinks Alan will be

   * over-confident
   * too clever
   * posh

   which would be bad because

   * he might make mistakes
   * he'll talk down to her
   * he won't fit in

3. In the interview, Alan feels

   * nervous
   * confident
   * calm
   * thrilled

   but he appears to be

   * confident
   * nervous
   * calm
   * thrilled

   because

   * his mum told him to act that way
   * he desperately wants the job
   * he feels exhausted

   He doesn't get the job.

4. At the end, Tanya runs after Alan because

   * she heard what he said on the phone
   * she forgot to ask one more question
   * she wants to tell him he made a mistake

5. Ultimately, Tanya

   * offers Alan the job
   * apologises to Alan
   * makes friends with Alan
