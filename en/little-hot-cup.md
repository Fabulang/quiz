1. Ariana works as an

   * accountant
   * barrista
   * cleaner
   * enterpreneur

   but she doesn't enjoy it.

2. Every day, Ariana buys a coffee from a café

   * in the morning
   * at lunchtime
   * in the afternoon

   and she drinks it

   * in the café
   * while she walks
   * at work

3. One day, the café is closed, because the owner

   * can't afford to open the café
   * didn't file correct accounts
   * is renovating the café
   * has health problems

   so Ariana offers some advice.

4. At the end, Ariana goes to the office at the back of the café because

   * she works at the café now
   * she's become friends with the owner
   * she's still giving the owner advice
   * she's helping with his accounts
