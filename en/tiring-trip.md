3. At a souvenir shop, the shopkeeper

   * thinks Ferdinand is negotiating about the price
   * realises Ferdinand is a tourist and tries to charge more
   * is aggressive, because he doesn't like tourists
   * offers Ferdinand a special discount

4. When Ferdinand wakes up, he is surrounded by bags full of

   * ice-cream
   * souvenirs
