1. Amelia finds a mirror with a snake design. She likes it because

   * it looks traditional
   * it looks exotic
   * she likes snakes
   * it has historical value

2. The antiques dealer gives Amelia the mirror for free, because

   * he's glad to get rid of it
   * he knows she'll pay him in the end
   * no one else wants it
   * it's a special deal

3. Amelia's reflection claims to be the real Amelia. What happens next?

   * They both inspect each other carefully.
   * They both want the other one to disappear.
   * One of them is rude to the other.
   * One of them tries to cross through the mirror.

4. Amelia thinks of a way to prove who is real, and who is a reflection:

   * just look at the clock
   * just look at each other's faces
   * just wait until the clock points at number one
   * just move the clock to the right
   * destroy the mirror

   So which Amelia was real, and which was the reflection?
