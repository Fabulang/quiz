1. Mr Thomas is suspicious of his neighbours because

   * they do gardening in the evening
   * they keep looking at him
   * they talk in a strange language

2. When the neighbours talk about roses and daisies, Mr Thomas thinks

   * "roses" and "daisies" have a hidden meaning
   * "roses" and "daisies" are passwords
   * they're pretending to be normal
   * they know he's listening

3. A television crew arrives at the neighbours' house, because the neighbours

   * are appearing in a television show
   * are the hosts of a television show
   * have been arrested
   * are celebrities

4. The neighbours do gardening in the evening because

   * it's too hot in the day
   * it's better for the plants
   * they have to work during the day
   * they're very strange people

5. The neighbours were whispering because

   * they didn't want to disturb Mr Thomas
   * they didn't want to wake up their cat
   * they really were hiding something
