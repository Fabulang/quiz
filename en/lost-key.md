1. 300 years ago, a pirate

   * lived in the house
   * robbed the house
   * attacked the house

2. Nicholas begins to look around the house, because

   * he hopes to find valuable items
   * he hopes to find a message from the pirate
   * he's lost his key
   * he has to check for any damage

3. An old woman visits Nicholas, because

   * Nicholas invited her
   * she wants to welcome him to the neighbourhood
   * she's also looking for the treasure
   * she wants Nicholas' money

4. Why are there no gold coins in the wooden box?

   * The box has nothing to do with the pirate
   * The woman already took the gold coins
   * The letter inside explains where to find the gold
   * They've both made a mistake

5. At the end, the old woman is crying, because

   * the letter has sentimental value to her
   * the letter is from her ancestor, the pirate
   * she's upset that they didn't find any gold
   * she realises they're going to be rich
