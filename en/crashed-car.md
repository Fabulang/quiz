   * in the country
   * in the city

   * driving at night in the forest

4. Adrian sees a crashed car. He realises that

   * it's his own car
   * it's his friend's car
   * the driver was a man like him
   * the car is in his imagination

   because the car's radio is playing the same song he was listening to.
