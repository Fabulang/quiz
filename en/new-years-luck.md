1. Alex is on a spaceship, feeling

   * depressed
   * hungry
   * jealous
   * angry

2. Alex feels unlucky because, three months ago, there was

   * an accident
   * an explosion
   * a malfunction

   and now the spaceship

   * has run out of energy
   * is lost in space
   * is stuck on an asteroid

3. The crew tells Alex stories about

   * things they do on New Year's Eve at home
   * why he was chosen for the mission
   * their favourite foods
   * their life stories

   which

   * cheers him up
   * makes him laugh
   * makes him miss home even more

4. By pure chance, there is a supernova nearby, which

   * charges up the spaceship's batteries
   * propels the spaceship back towards Earth
   * damages the spaceship even further
   * destroys the solar panels

5. In the end, Alex feels lucky, because

   * he has good friends on the spaceship
   * he's seen an incredible, unlikely spectacle
   * they're going to survive after all
   * the crew respect his expertise
